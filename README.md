# TTA-Csharp-Projects
These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework
## Projects:
- [Car Insurance](https://github.com/Itz-Djin/TTA-Csharp-Projects/tree/main/Assignments/CarInsurance)
- [Newsletter](https://github.com/Itz-Djin/TTA-Csharp-Projects/tree/main/Assignments/NewsletterAppMVC)
### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
### Newsletter
This is a data visualization application that is meant to store and display user's who have subscribe to a mock newsletter. It is an MVC web application that utilizes Entity Framework 6 for data access and a Code First Workflow. It is a project that can include more functions if need be.
